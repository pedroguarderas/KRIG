Description: Implements different methods for spatial statistics, in particular focused in
    kriging based models. We count with different implemented models, simple, ordinary and 
    universal forms of kriging, cokriging and regression kriging models. Includes, multivariate 
    sensitivity analysis under an approximation designed over Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces and 
    computation of Sobol indexes under this framework.
