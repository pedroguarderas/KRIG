Description: Implements different methods for spatial statistics, in particular focused in
    Kriging based models. We count with different implemented models, simple, ordinary and 
    universal forms of Kriging, co-Kriging and regression Kriging models. Includes, multivariate 
    sensitivity analysis under an approximation designed over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and 
    computation of Sobol indexes under this framework.
